# C Repository
Welcome to my C repository. This is a collection of miscellaneous files written in C that explore various concepts and ideas that can be used for reference or fun.

## Purpose
This repository is intended to be used as a cache for various C files which contain a variety of ideas and solutions. Many of these are one-off ideas or answers to small coding challenges I have done in the past.

The goal is to create a mini library of various C solutions that can be used as a reference for any situation.

## Compiling Files
Most of these files are ready to be compiled and used for the end-user. You can compile these files by running the following command within Linux:
```
gcc <name-of-c-file> -o <name-of-your-choice-for-executable>
```
The name of the executable can be anything you want. You can also run the command as `gcc <name-of-file>` without the `-o` flag, in which case the name of the executable will be `a.out`.
If there are multiple files within a folder, you will want to compile the `main.c` file. To execute the file, simply run the command:
```
./a.out OR ./<name-of-c-file>
```
